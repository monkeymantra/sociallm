The service is called Sociallm and it's an api for using chatgpt 4 to generate tweets. It has the following entities:

    - Calendar
    - User
    - Event
    - CalendarTokens
    - TwitterTokens
    - Tweets
    - Schedule

Note the two "Tokens" models. These store oauth tokens from Google and Twitter.

We'll need models for all of them.

Calendar has:
- id
- user
- url
- tokenId
- Schedule

User has:
- id
- name
- email
- commercial (boolean)

Event has:
- start
- end
- name
- description (yaml)
- location

The service tweets for every event on the calendar based on the Calendar's Schedule:

Besides an Id, the Schedule object contains an object that describes the timing for tweets for events on that calendar.
